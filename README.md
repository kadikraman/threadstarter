# Threadstarter

Do you love Slack threads?

Do your colleagues keep forgetting about them?

Are you looking for a ~~passive aggressive~~ helpful way to remind them?

Well then THIS is a bot for YOU.

## Features

- replies to every message in a channel it's been added to with "Remember to use threads!"
- will delete the above message once a subsequent message has been added
